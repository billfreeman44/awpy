# Updating these Files

## Updating map_data.json

The files that contain the `x`, `y`, and `scale` values for each map will be in your `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource\overviews\...` folder. They are named like `[map_name].txt`. You should see a row with `pos_x`, `pos_y`, and `scale` in the text file (all other values are irrelevant). Update the `map_data.json` file with those values, keeping with the same style as the other entries.
